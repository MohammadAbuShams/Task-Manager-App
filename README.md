# Task Manager App

A more complex **Task Manager Application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows users to manage their tasks with features like creating, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks by their status. It also uses **localStorage** to persist tasks between sessions.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Create a new task with a default "Pending" status.
- **Edit Task**: Update the description of a task.
- **Delete Task**: Remove a task from the list.
- **Update Task Status**: Change the status of tasks between "Pending", "In Progress", and "Completed".
- **Filter Tasks**: View tasks filtered by their status.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they remain after refreshing.
